## Introduction to the Redux Challenges

[Redux](https://redux.js.org/)is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.

It is small and unopinionated and helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. On top of that, it provides a great developer experience, such as live code editing combined with a time traveling debugger.

You can use Redux together with React, or with any other view library. It is tiny (2kB, including dependencies), but has a large ecosystem of addons available.
